A simple browser extension that lets you use the Enter key to submit comments and posts across any website. Hell, bind your Enter key to anywhere you want! No more moving around the mouse - just press Enter and post!

It's just that I personally, just never want to remove my hands off the keyboard when I'm doing anything on pc. Soulse games excluded hahaha. Very straightforward quality-of-life update I wanted to share w/ you. 


## Features

- 🎯 One-time setup per website
- ⌨️ Use Enter key to submit on any website
- 🔒 All settings stored locally in your browser
- 🎨 Works with buttons, forms, and comment sections
- 🌐 Compatible with any website
- 🚀 Lightweight and fast

## How It Works

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` to start recording mode
2. Click the submit button you want to bind to Enter
3. Done! Now just press Enter to submit

The extension will remember your button selection for each website, so you only need to set it up once per site.

## Installation

1. Download the extension from Releases section, unzip it and hit Load Unpacked in your browser, provided Developer Mode is enabled.

2. Click on the extension icon in your browser to see usage instructions

## Important Notes

- The extension can only interact with buttons that are visible on the page
- Works with:
  - Text areas
  - Input fields
  - Contenteditable elements
- Use `Shift + Enter` for line breaks when you don't want to submit

## Privacy & Security
